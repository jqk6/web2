My oh my do you want to say goodbye? 
To have the kingdom, baby, tell me why 
My oh my do you want to say goodbye? 
To rule the country, baby, you and I? 

If you were my King,

[Chorus]
My oh my do you want to say goodbye? 
To have the Kingdom, baby, tell me why 
My oh my do you want to say goodbye? 
To rule the country, baby, you and I? 

Little princess in a terrible mess, 
A kingdom alone, with no love is confessed 
Dreams of a prince on a tall white horse, 
Runs like a spirit by the castle walls. 

Gotta steal from the rich, when they don't know I'm coming, 
Gotta give to the poor, no time for lovin' 
My oh my don't you cry, 'cause there is no way I'm staying, 
I will leave say bye bye, I'm going my way

[Chorus]

If you were my King, (Oh)
I would be your Queen, (Oh)
If you were my King, (Oh)
I would be your Queen, (Oh)

Mystery deep in the royal heart 
Crying at night, I want to be apart 
Prince, oh, prince are you really sincere? 
That you one day are gonna disappear? 

Gotta steal from the rich, when they don't know I'm coming, 
Gotta give to the poor, no time for lovin' 
My oh my don't you cry, 'cause there is no way I'm staying, 
I will leave say "bye bye", I'm going my way

My oh my (Oh) 
My oh my (Oh)
My oh my (Oh)
My oh my! 

[Chorus: x2]

If you were my King,
I would be your Queen, 
If you were my King, 
I would be your Queen.
